# AppAutoPB

AppAutoPB is java based automation for use with a Android Consumer Mobile Application.

## Installation

These files would need to be used in conjunction with a optimised Eclipse/Appium project held by the author.  They currently setup for use with specific devices, I have placed them in the public domain for ease of reference.

## Usage

The ProdAppStateless java files are written to pull methods from MethodRepo & element IDs/xPaths from their designations in the ElementRepo. Each file in ProdAppStateless is written to test specific features of the mobile application under test.  The scripts will check the properties of elements, verify text boxes, scroll to elements, compare values, check error messages, take screenshots & many other useful tests.  ProdStatelessTestSuites will run a number of scripts in sequence to cover a whole section of features such as the app Welcome Page and its sub pages such as Member Login or Member Registration.

## Contributing
I welcome any comments regarding the code, this is my first fully fledged Java automation project and I am constantly making improvements.
